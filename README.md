# 🌐 Web Projects Collection

This repository is a curated collection of complete web projects I developed while studying front-end development and user interface design.

Each project is fully finished, responsive and deployed, representing my evolution building real websites from scratch.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

Instead of keeping dozens of small repositories, this repo gathers my main **complete website projects** in one place as a portfolio of front-end work.

The focus of these projects includes:

- Modern UI and animations
- Responsive layouts
- Landing pages and institutional websites
- Interactive components
- Realistic website structures
